# Matmod: Matrix Model Generator for Implicative Connectives

This repository is mostly an experiment to help
me better understand matrix models.

You're likely better off using [arranstewart/magic](https://github.com/arranstewart/magic).

We support output from magic using the ugly data format.

```
python3 parse_magic.py < UGLY_FILE_FROM_MAGIC
```
